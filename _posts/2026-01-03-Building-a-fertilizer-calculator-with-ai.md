description: My experience building a hydroponic fertilizer calculator using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and OpenAI Codex.

I recently built a [fertilizer calculator](https://umangbhatt.in/fertilizer-calculator/) for hydroponic gardening using Vue.js. What made this project interesting was using two different AI coding assistants: Claude Sonnet 4.5 and OpenAI Codex.

## Key Takeaway

Codex initially struggled with basics like reading files properly, but has caught up significantly. Where it clearly shines is specialized domain knowledge. EC prediction requires understanding ion dissociation, molar conductivity, and how different salts contribute to conductivity. Codex knew the science; Sonnet did not.

Use the right tool for the job. Sometimes that means combining multiple AI assistants.
